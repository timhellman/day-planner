# DAY PLANNER

This is a Day Planner created by Tim Hellman.



## DESCRIPTION

This Day Planner was designed for the sophisticated and discerning student of 
web development that finds herself at a loss for what to do with each of the taxing
and demanding hours of her day.  There are lines of code here whose functionality
I don't fully understand, but my hope is that my lack of understanding doesn't get
in the way of the user's well-planned day.     



## USAGE

With this Day Planner, any time-fearing student can input her hourly tasks in an
organized and efficient way.   The tasks can be saved in local storage for future 
reference.   The current hour will be highlighted in red, telling the student "this
is the only task you should be doing at this hour."  Activities of hours past 
will be highlighted in gray, and future tasks highlighted in green.  



## CONTRIBUTIONS

This project was worked on with Kevin Fujimoto and Blake The Quake - our work might look similar.
Images were taken from the insert to ZZ Top's "Tres Hombres" album and the blog Internet K-Hole.
